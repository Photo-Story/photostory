# Photostory

Photostory lets you take a picture of yourself every day, and compile them into a video, showing the story of your life as photos of you.

Here's a video of what it should look like:

[![Noah takes a photo of himself every day for 12.5 years.](http://img.youtube.com/vi/iPPzXlMdi7o/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPPzXlMdi7o "Noah takes a photo of himself every day for 12.5 years.")

This program hasn't been updated since 2011, so things may not work as intended.  If you'd like to help out, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
